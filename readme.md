# üë®‚Äçüç≥üë®‚Äçüç≥ Docs Cook-Off :: Mintlify Edition

For each Docs Cook-off, we select a popular documentation platform or service. Then, we bring in a world-class team to help us cook up a few challenges with that platform. For each challenge, we use the same lorem ipsum text and documentation filler.

All projects cannot be everything to everyone and have to make trade-offs. 
Over the course of the cook-off, we hope to identify the biggest differentiators and trade-offs major platforms have made. We highligh the pros and cons of each platform so you can make the best call for your team‚Äôs goals and technical capacities.

In our repo, you can find branches with Nextra and Docusaurus. You can also follow along as we work on today‚Äôs platform: Mintlify.

According to their website, Mintlify is an AI-powered documentation tool 
that helps developers generate and maintain documentation from their code. 
It‚Äôs a paid service and closed-source (the first of these we‚Äôve done).
