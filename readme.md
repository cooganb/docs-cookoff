# 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳 Docs Cook-Off Main Repo

​Welcome to Docs Cook-Off! Where we sizzle sidebars, marinate markdown and juilenne javascript to help you find the perfect platform for your documentation needs.

​For each Docs Cook-off, we select a popular documentation platform or service. Then, we bring in a world-class team to help us cook up a few challenges with that platform. For each challenge, we use the same lorem ipsum text and documentation filler.

Each documentation platform has its own branch in this repo. So far, the ones we have available are:

* [Docusaurus](https://github.com/cooganb/docs-cookoff/tree/docusaurus)
* Mintlify (🔜)
* [Nextra](https://github.com/cooganb/docs-cookoff/tree/nextra)
* Readme (🔜)
* Gitbook (🔜)
* VitePress (🔜)
* Astro (🔜)
* Vocs (🔜)
* Mkdocs (🔜)
* mdBook (🔜)
