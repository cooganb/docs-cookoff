# Opening Blurb

Welcome to Docs Cook-Off! Where we sizzle sidebars, marinate markdown and juilenne javascript to help you find the perfect platform for your documentation needs. 

My name is Coogan and I look like the answer to the question, "Where can I find an off-brand version of Jeremy Allen White who's got the same overall aggro-bro look without the muscles or charisma?"

For each Docs Cook-off, we select a popular documentation platform or service. Then, we bring in a world-class team to help us cook up a few challenges with that platform. For each challenge, we use the same lorem ipsum text and documentation filler. 

Over the course of the cook-off, we hope to highlight the pros and cons of a platform, identifying the biggest differentiators and trade-offs platforms provide. All this to help you, the developer, find for the best documentation platform to serve to your customers.

Let's take a look at what got delivered to the coding kitchen for today's cook-off. 

Wow, I'm looking at a fresh box of Nextra, the documentation platform based on Next.js, the React framework. It's the documentation engine behind the docs for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn), and [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), among others. You can really taste the freshness of the React here along with the sharp-but-subtle notes of Markdown. Mmmmm, I think this is going to be delicious!
 
Today, to help us with the cook-off, we're graced with presence of two excellent chefs. Chef Luke, from Irys, and Chef Priyank, from Avail. Chefs, how are you today? Why don't you introduce yourselves and what you've cooked recently with Nextra?
