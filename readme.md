# 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳 Docs Cook-Off: Nextra Edition

​Welcome to Docs Cook-Off! Where we sizzle sidebars, marinate markdown and juilenne javascript to help you find the perfect platform for your documentation needs.

This is the **Nextra** branch, featuring Nextra, the documentation platform built on Next.js. It's the documentation engine behind the docs for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn), [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/), [Irys](https://docs.irys.xyz/), [Avail](https://docs.availproject.org/) and more. 

_You can see us build the first few commits on this repo in [this livestream here.](https://x.com/spaceagente/status/1833854487557226744)_
